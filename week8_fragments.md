## Fragments

A fragment is an object that represents and controls a reusable portion of the app's UI. 
A fragment defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its own input events.
However, Fragments must be hosted by an activity or another fragment. 

Fragments implement the "master-detail design pattern," where one the "master" keeps a list of items and selecting an item from the list shows the item's "detail."

Fragments make apps more modular.

When fragments need data from the hosted activity, an activity uses fragment arguments to provide data to the fragment.

### Examples:
1. The Band Database app (zyBooks)

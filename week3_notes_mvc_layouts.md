### MVC Pattern

Model-View-Controller is a popular pattern for organizing code while separating the concerns of the business logic (Model), the UI (View), and the application logic (Controller).

A layout defines the structure of the UI in an app and follows a hierarchy of View and ViewGroup objects.

A View draws something the user can see and interact with.

A ViewGroup is an invisible layout and container for the View and other ViewGroup objects.

Android offers several types of layouts to work with:

LinearLayout can be arranged vertically or horizontally with the android:orientation attribute.

The RelativeLayout arranges Views relative to each other and is challenging to work with.

ConstraintLayout arranges Views relative with each other using horizontal and vertical constraints and provides for automated features to aid in the process.

TableLayout arranges  Views in rows and columns.

GridLayout arranges Views in a grid format, where each child occupies a single grid cell.

FrameLayout can display a single View or overlay multiple Views.
